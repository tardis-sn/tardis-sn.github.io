### What

Participants will learn how to perform scientific quality spectral synthesis of explosive transients with TARDIS to measure key parameters in supernova ejecta, such as elemental composition. The summer school will consist of short lectures and hands-on labs guided by TARDIS developers to promote an understanding of the underlying physics necessary, a cursory understanding of how the code handles those physics, and how to make better use of the code in astrophysics research.

### When

Monday, July 28th, 2025 through Thursday, July 31st, 2025. [Click here to apply](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeP4jeugQlSjl5w3ScUmMTRw0gTXA1klDmAQiigMESbPzVO0g/viewform).
