We successfully hosted the TARDIS Summer School 2025, a week-long intensive program that brought together 15 researchers from around the world. Participants dove deep into the fundamentals of explosive transient radiative transfer and plasma physics, building a strong theoretical foundation for understanding supernova spectroscopy and the physics behind cosmic explosions.

The hands-on component of the school focused on practical applications using the TARDIS spectral synthesis code. Students learned to set up simulations, interpret results, and create synthetic spectra for various supernova models.
