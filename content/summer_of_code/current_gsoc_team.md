## GSoC {{< current_year >}} Org Admins & Mentors { .anchor-offset}

GSoC {{< current_year >}} was made possible by the following members:

### GSoC Org-Admins

Org admins coordinate participation of TARDIS in the Google Summer of Code. They complete all administrative tasks like submitting the application to participate, requesting slots, ensuring that mentors fill out evaluations in a timely fashion, etc. They may also act as mentors simultaneously during the GSoC.
