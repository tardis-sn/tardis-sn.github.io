title: "AI and LLM Usage Policy"

If you use any AI or LLMs, **you must disclose their use in your PRs and/or conversations with your mentor**. Additionally, you must fully understand and be able to explain any AI-generated code you submit. Any undisclosed use of AI or Large Language Models, or inability to explain AI-generated contributions, will be grounds for instant disqualification.

## Responsibility and Use

Using AI does not change your responsibility:

- You are responsible for what you submit, publish, or run
- AI-generated code or text must be understood before use
- Errors introduced by AI are still your responsibility

AI is a productivity multiplier, not an excuse for shallow understanding.<br>
Learning to use these tools well is now part of being an effective researcher, engineer, and collaborator.
