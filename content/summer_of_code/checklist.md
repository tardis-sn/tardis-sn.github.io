If you are interested in participating, please contact us through <a href="https://gitter.im/tardis-sn/gsoc" target="_blank">Gitter</a> and introduce yourself. Members of the TARDIS collaboration will actively engage with questions on the Gitter!

### The Application Process

1. Get familiar with TARDIS
   - Go to the <a href="https://tardis-sn.github.io/tardis/" target="_blank">documentation</a> page.
   - Install the software using the <a href="https://tardis-sn.github.io/tardis/installation.html" target="_blank">guide</a>.
   - Run the [example](https://tardis-sn.github.io/tardis/quickstart.html).
   - Get familiar with our [development model](https://tardis-sn.github.io/tardis/contributing/development/index.html) using Git and GitHub.
2. Do the [TARDIS intro challenge](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ojC-CbdvhsnNum9DHxY-JUqlGiZGotDP?usp=sharing).
3. Submit your completed [TARDIS challenge](https://forms.gle/ov1f71qogP36qLMc7).
4. Check out the [Ideas Page](../ideas).
5. Introduce yourself to us on <a href="https://gitter.im/tardis-sn/gsoc" target="_blank">Gitter</a>.
6. Start your [application](../other_requirements#application-guidelines).
7. Select a project.
   - Many projects have additional specific instructions. They often involve a Pull Request.
8. Discuss and share your project details (don't wait!)
9. Submit your application!

### You got accepted (before coding begins)

1. Agree to the [acceptance requirements](../other_requirements#participation-requirements) **in writing**.
2. Read our participation [expectations](../other_requirements#participation-expectations) (read it ALL, we will quiz you later).
3. Set up an interaction schedule with your mentors (at least weekly).
4. Fill out your profile (one sentence summary, your name, link to proposal, dev log, and GSoC page).
5. Get familiarized with web resources-
   - [Gitter](https://gitter.im/tardis-sn/gsoc)
   - [GitHub](https://github.com/tardis-sn/tardis)
6. Post your proposal online (Google Docs, overleaf, wiki, etc.)

8. Announce your plan via Chat and/or E-mail (discuss and make adjustments).
9. Submit patches to get familiarized with code (find small tasks like these).

### Once coding begins

1. Write maintainable, portable, complete code.
2. Keep a daily log of your activities online somewhere (a blog or your wiki user page is great for this).
3. We expect you to sign-in/sign off on Gitter on working days and give us a short summary of your plans for the day.
4. Provide a midterm report on your project progress to your mentors as well as posting it to your blog or wiki log.
5. Stay motivated, engage other devs, allocate time for discussions.
6. Provide a final report on your project progress.
7. Keep working on TARDIS-SN!
