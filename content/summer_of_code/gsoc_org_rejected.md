We’d like to share that we won’t be participating as a mentoring organization for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) {{< current_year >}}. While we’re taking a break this year, we’re still committed to our open-source projects and invite students and contributors to explore and get involved with our work.

- **Contribute to Other GSoC Organizations**: Discover other amazing organizations participating in GSoC {{< current_year >}} by visiting the [list of GSoC mentoring organizations](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations).
