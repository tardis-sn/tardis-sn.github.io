Our research group is designed to be highly interactive, offering a supportive environment where members can explore their interests and develop their careers. Every member is paired with mentors, including senior researchers and postdocs, and has the opportunity to mentor others, fostering a dynamic exchange of knowledge. We meet regularly to discuss scientific progress, tackle challenges, and brainstorm ideas. Additionally, we set aside dedicated time each year to focus on career development, professional networking, and ensuring that each member's work aligns with their future goals.

Our weekly meetings are diverse, covering presentations, discussions on scientific topics, research ethics, and tutorials on software development and writing. Collaboration is central to our group, with members frequently working together to solve technical and scientific challenges. We actively encourage a culture where everyone supports one another, both through formal mentoring relationships and informal collaboration, helping the group grow and succeed collectively.

## Undergraduate Students

We welcome undergraduate students from Michigan State University and beyond to join our research group. Whether you're an MSU student or applying through programs like the Physics & Astronomy or ACRES Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU), there are multiple ways to get involved. Students in our group gain hands-on experience in computational astrophysics, high-performance computing, data visualization, data science techniques, and open-source software development.

By joining our group, you'll work closely with senior members, including doctoral students and postdocs, on cutting-edge research projects. Many of our undergraduates have co-authored papers, contributed to open-source software, and presented at conferences. Students can also participate for class credit, seamlessly integrating research into their academic programs.

##### There are several ways to join:

- **Honors College at MSU:** MSU students can apply to be professorial assistants through the Honors College, allowing them to engage in research early on.
- **Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU):** REU programs offer structured research opportunities with mentorship.
- **Google Summer of Code:** Our lab participates in Google Summer of Code, a great way to contribute to open-source projects and enhance your skills.
- **Open-Source Contributions:** Students can also contribute to our open-source tools, gaining valuable experience in the scientific community.

If you're interested, [reach out](#)! We typically look for students with basic Python skills and at least one semester of calculus and physics.

## Graduate Students

Our goal for graduate students is to help them become well-rounded computational scientists. Along with advancing skills in astrophysics, mathematics, and software development, we place a strong emphasis on developing professional skills such as teaching, presentations, networking, collaboration, mentoring, and software engineering. These skills are essential for enhancing career competitiveness across various fields.

We are currently looking for doctoral students interested in areas like supernova physics and radiative transfer. Students have the option to pursue a doctorate in Physics & Astronomy, Computational Mathematics, Science, and Engineering (CMSE), or even a joint degree across these disciplines. Interested students should contact us to discuss potential opportunities and plan their applications for the appropriate program by the application deadlines. We also encourage students interested in applying for national fellowships, such as the NSF GRFP or DOE CSGF, to [reach out](#)!

##### Possible Research Projects:
- Understanding the diversity of thermonuclear white dwarf explosions
- The nature of stripping in stripped core-collapse supernovae
- Numerical methods for radiative transfer in supernovae

Successful students in our group typically have a strong computational background, with expertise in languages like Python or C++, and hold degrees in astrophysics, physics, or applied mathematics.

## Postdoctoral Researchers

We aim to offer postdoctoral researchers the flexibility and support to pursue innovative research that aligns with our group's focus areas. Postdocs are encouraged to engage in mentoring, contribute to grant proposals, and expand their professional networks, all of which help strengthen their career opportunities.

We are actively seeking funding for postdoctoral positions and are happy to collaborate with those interested in applying for fellowships such as Hubble/Chandra or NSF AAPF. If you're interested, feel free to [reach out](#) to discuss potential opportunities.

##### Opportunities:
- **Common Envelope Events in Binary Star Systems:** Candidates will use TARDIS to post-process hydrodynamic simulations and generate synthetic spectra for common envelope events. The project involves analyzing how mass transfer and interactions between stars affect their evolution. For more information see https://aas.org/jobregister/ad/2930606a.

- **Late-Phase Type Ia Supernova Studies:** This position focuses on analyzing nebular spectroscopy and light curves of late-phase Type Ia supernovae. Candidates will also work on enhancing the microphysics in TARDIS and comparing the results with recent observational spectral data. For more information see https://aas.org/jobregister/ad/2930606a.


## Visiting Scientists

We are always open to collaborations with visiting scientists interested in joining our group for research on topics aligned with our focus areas. Whether you have a specific project in mind or want to explore shared interests, we are eager to offer our space, expertise, and resources to support your work. Visitors have joined us for stays ranging from a week to several months, depending on the nature of the collaboration.

There are several options for funding, and projects related to transients may be eligible for support through IRENA. If you already have funding or need assistance in securing it, we're happy to explore the possibilities together.
