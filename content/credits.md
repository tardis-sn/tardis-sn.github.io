We provide TARDIS as a free, open-source tool. If you are using it, please
adhere to a few policies and acknowledge the TARDIS Team.

## Publication Policies


If you use this code for any publications or presentations please acknowledge
it.  Please cite <a href = "http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.440..387K">
Kerzendorf & Sim 2014</a> in the text and add the
following paragraph to the Acknowledgement section:

   This research made use of \textsc{Tardis}, a community-developed software package for spectral
    synthesis in supernovae \citep{2014MNRAS.440..387K, |ZENODO|}. The
    development of \textsc{Tardis} received support from the Google Summer of Code initiative and
    from ESA's Summer of Code in Space program. \textsc{Tardis} makes extensive use of Astropy
    and PyNE.


If you use any of the full relativity treatments or use TARDIS for modelling
Type II supernovae, also add <a href= "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...621A..29V">
Spectral modeling of type II supernovae. I. Dilution factors</a> to the Acknowledgement.

    \citep{2019A&A...621A..29V}
