Her work focused on improving the convergence behavior of TARDIS by studying the stability of its fixed-point iteration scheme and introducing adaptive damping strategies to accelerate it. Deeksha began by developing a convergence framework to analyze and visualize iteration behavior across different supernova types and noise conditions. Building on this, she implemented adaptive damping techniques that respond to residual trends, with the goal of speeding up convergence while maintaining numerical stability.Her benchmarking efforts explored the effects of damping parameters, random seeds, and initial conditions on convergence across hundreds of simulations. We thank her for her contributions and wish her the best in her future endeavors.",

These events are key for studying the final stages of stellar evolution, binary interactions, and stellar wind effects of massive stars. However, their origins and explosion mechanisms remain uncertain. [jing_lu] and her collaborators took part in tackling these challenges by studying the synthetic observables of a set of physics-driven explosions of massive stars that potentially lead to SESNe.",

The results indicate that progenitors with higher ejecta masses produce broader light curves, consistent with some observed SESNe, but their peak luminosities are lower than expected. Methods commonly used to estimate ejecta mass based on radiative-powered light curves were shown to have uncertainties up to 160%, highlighting the need for self-consistent physics-based models. Additionally, the analysis found that helium lines are detectable even in models with very small helium masses, emphasizing the role of radiation field and ejecta composition in shaping spectral features.",

Positronium is a bound system of an electron and a positron that is stable for only a very short time (nanoseconds). It has a chance to be formed as part of the beta decay process of radioactive elements in supernovae. When the electron-positron pair annihilate each other, they can produce either 2 or 3 gamma-rays. We wrote code to sample the possible gamma-ray energies by inverting the integral description from Ore & Powell (1949).",
            "2_para": "This sampler will be used as part of the gamma-ray energy deposition module for TARDIS that is currently under development. It will enable TARDIS to accurately simulate the formation and annihilation of positronium and the resulting gamma-ray spectra and deposition rates.",
            "3_para": "In addition to adding samplers for new physics processes, TARDIS team members added new sampling features to the existing radiative transfer framework.  [jack_o_brien], [anirban_dutta], and [wolfgang_kerzendorf] wrote a weighted sampler implementation for the Monte Carlo packet instantiation.  This new sampler allows TARDIS to draw more packet samples in wavelength regions with low radiative intensity to improve the quality of the statistics, especially near the red and blue ends of the spectrum.  In contrast to the original packet sampler, which generates packets at each frequency with a probability corresponding to its initial radiative intensity, the weighted sampler works by drawing frequencies for each packet uniformly across the spectrum and assigning a weight to each packet based on the initial radiative intensity.  In the future, this sampler will serve to help TARDIS both track and actively improve its sampling efficiency in undersampled regions of the spectrum as well as serve as a base for more complex importance samplers."

In his first project he investigated the SN 1006 remnant for hypervelocity white dwarfs, interesting peculiar stars that could might result from SN Ia. In his second project, he investigated the SNR 0509-67.5 remnant in the Large Magellanic Cloud, testing a large collection of SN Ia progenitor scenarios by modelling the spectral energy distributions of all the stars inside the remnant. He then developed the STARDIS code, an adaptation of TARDIS, able to model stellar atmospheres and produce spectra of surviving companions. He will continue working with us, improving the functionality of TARDIS. He is an integral part of our group, and we are ecstatic to see what he does next.",
