The Carsus project will be updated to use the latest data source by default by checking for updates in the data repository. Additionally, a utility function will be implemented in the Carsus to support using the older version of the datasets available on the data repository by passing the dataset version number.",

Nuclear decay data are stored by the NNDC in a format that is difficult to read and compile called ENSDF. The NNDC also provides a parser for this data online called \u201cradlist\u201d. This project involves using the ENSDF archives from NNDC and the parser to download, process, and store nuclear decay data for all available isotopes in the Carsus HDF output."
